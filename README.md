## Reasoning/Motivation

Built as a refresher on front end topics

## Technologies Used
* Vanilla JS 
* Real DOM manipulation (.add, .remove,. parentElement, .children, innerHTML, textContent)
* Array Manipulation methods (.filter, .forEach)
* FontAwesome 
* Bootstrap 

## Challenges

* Forgot that if I do not convert and use .toLowerCase() method for search bar it will not match
* Refresher on array manipulation methods and vanilla JS as I have been using ES6+ with React/Redux

## Next Steps

* Making this in react perhaps pairing it with a database for users to use
